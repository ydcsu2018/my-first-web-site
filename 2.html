<h2>CSS</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a style sheet language used for specifying
 the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>If the markup language (ex: HTML) is responsible for the body of the website, CSS is responsible for decorating it like clothes and accessories. In other words, you can decorate it like a completely different website by leaving the HTML structure the same and changing the CSS file.</p>
